# Rails App Generator

> Create new Rails Application with custom opinions

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_app_generator'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install rails_app_generator
```

## Notes

You can use rails_app_generator to create Rails 7 applications
You can use rails_app_generator with ruby 2.7 or 3.1

Rails new uses a batteries included approach, this means that you get everything and if you don't want a feature you need to turn it off explicitly using --skip-feature
I hope to change the focus in this project so that you get very minimal installation and then you turn on what you want explicitly.
Templates for rails are separated from templates for addons

## Stories

### Main Story

As a Developer, I want to create new Rails application with flexible opinions so that I can build different rails proof of concepts

See all [stories](./STORIES.md)


## Usage
See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)



## Development

Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/klueless-io/rails_app_generator
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Aaa::Bbb::Program.execute()
# => ""
```

`rails_app_generator` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, build the gem and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```bash
rake publish
rake clean
```
